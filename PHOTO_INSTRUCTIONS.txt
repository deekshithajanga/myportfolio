PROFILE PHOTO INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

To add your actual profile photo:

1. Save your photo as "profile-photo.jpg" in the "public" folder
2. Replace the current "profile-photo.svg" file
3. Update the Hero.js file to use "profile-photo.jpg" instead of "profile-photo.svg"

Your photo should be:
- High quality (500x500 pixels or larger)
- Professional looking
- Good lighting
- Centered on your face
- JPG, PNG, or WebP format

The photo will automatically be cropped to a circle in the Hero section.
